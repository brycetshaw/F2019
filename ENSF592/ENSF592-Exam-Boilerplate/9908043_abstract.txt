{\bf Computers are physical systems: what they can and cannot do is 
 dictated by the laws of physics$^{1-86}$.   In particular, the speed with
 which a physical device can process information is limited by
 its energy$^{11-26}$ and the amount of information that it can process
 is limited by the number of degrees of freedom it possesses$^{5-40}$.
 This paper explores the physical limits of computation
 as determined by the speed of light $c$, the quantum scale $\hbar$
 and the gravitational constant $G$.  As an example, quantitative
 bounds are put to the computational power of an `ultimate laptop' 
 with a mass of one kilogram confined to a volume of one liter.}
